    <p1> Hi there, it's Neha! I'm a high school student, artist, and all-things business related enthusiast who lives in sunny California. I currently am a rising senior that enjoys tennis, particiapting in entrepreneurship competitions like DECA, and dancing. I'm quirky, different, and like trying new things. Above all, I'm short and sweet. No literally.     </p1>
 
    <h2 style="color:blue;"> My Projects </h2>
    <p2> Welcome to my world, where princesses are strong, brave, and heroes! The Princess's Quest is a game created in Scratch by me. Avoid monsters, collect keys, and fight a fire-breathing dragon to free your prince from danger - all while wearing a beautiful gown and a sparkling princess crown. </p2>
